#Main file for program execution and functionality

# ROADMAP #1: Import necessary modules (random, os, sys, etc.)

# ROADMAP #2: Define constants for map size, number of mines, tile symbols, etc.

# ROADMAP #3: Create functions to generate a random minefield with a designated start point in the center and at least one clear tile adjacent to the start.

# ROADMAP #4: Implement a function to display the minefield in the terminal, showing revealed and unrevealed tiles.

# ROADMAP #5: Handle user input for coordinates (e.g., "a1", "b5"), including input validation and conversion to map indices.

# ROADMAP #6: Implement game logic for revealing tiles, checking for mines, and handling win/loss conditions.

# ROADMAP #7: Track the number of clear tiles revealed by the user for scoring purposes.

# ROADMAP #8: On game completion (win or loss), prompt the user for their initials and calculate their score.

# ROADMAP #9: Write the user's initials and score to scoreboard.txt.

# ROADMAP #10: Implement a main game loop to tie all components together and restart or exit as needed.
